# Library-management-System-
A library is a place where a huge collection of books and resources are 
available which can be accessible by the users. In traditional libraries, 
the students have to search for books which is a hassle process and 
there is no proper maintenance of the database about issues and fines. 
The overall progress of work is slow and it is impossible to generate a 
fast report.  The librarians have to work allotted for arranging, and 
sorting books in the book sales. At the same time, they have to check 
and monitor the lent and borrowed book details with fine. 
To tackle this problem, we have designed a Library Management 
System using Python. Library management means efficient and 
effective management of material (information sources), machinery, 
men (human resources), technology and money to meet the objectives 
of the library. Our system can help librarians to work easily. This 
computerization of the library helps in many instances of its 
maintenance. It reduces the workload of management as most of the 
manual work done is reduced.
